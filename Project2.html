          This project was a display of mySQL database management and design. This was the final project of the class and a culmination of the skills learned throughout the course. 
          Over the course of the semester, we designed and added onto a database for a fictional company, and then used SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data from the database.
          This project is the final product of that database, and the queries that I used to retrieve data from it. This ER Diagram displays the structure of the database, and the relationships between the tables.

          Before this project, I had never worked with any form of SQL or managing databases. This project taught me a lot about database design, management, and SQL queries.
          I learned how to design a database from scratch, and how to use SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data from it. It made me more familiar with database concepts and SQL syntax.
